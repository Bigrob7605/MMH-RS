# ðŸš€ **MMH-RS V2.0 ROADMAP: GPU Acceleration Revolution**

**Unleash the Full Powerâ€”No More Waiting, No More Limits**

## ðŸŽ¯ **TL;DR: What V2 Delivers**

V2 is the leap. We're leaving CPU bottlenecks behind. This is GPU-native compression, decompression, and testingâ€”built for the era of AI workloads, big models, and huge data. Your RTX, your CUDA, your OpenCL stack? Now they're weapons, not paperweights.

## ðŸ”¥ **Core Features**

### 1. **GPU-Accelerated Compression and Decompression**
- **10Ã—â€“20Ã— faster than CPU-only**: Real-world: 1000+ MB/s compression, 5000+ MB/s decompression (RTX 4070-class or better)
- **Parallel everything**: Multi-GPU, multi-threaded, async pipeline. Scale as wide as your rig can handle
- **Massive datasets**: Folders, directories, giant model checkpointsâ€”fold and unfold in minutes, not hours

### 2. **Full Model/Directory Support**
- **Whole-model folding**: Compress entire LLMs, diffusion nets, RL agents, or directories containing code, configs, and weights
- **Directory-aware**: Smart chunking, cross-file deduplication, global dictionary sharing. Save space on every run

### 3. **Zero-Loss, Bit-Perfect Unfolding**
- **No "GPU artifacting"**: Just precision. Every file, model, or dataset unfolds exactly as packed
- **Integrity guaranteed**: SHA-256 and Merkle verification after every operation

### 4. **Real-Time, Live Compression for AI Workloads**
- **Stream it, don't wait for it**: Compress and move active AI datasets, logs, checkpoints, and outputs liveâ€”even while training
- **Cloud/edge ready**: Works local or remote. Pipeline direct to cloud, NAS, or distributed storage

### 5. **Developer and Researcher Ready**
- **Human + agent launchers**: One-click for power users, automated for pipelines and CI
- **Linux, Windows, WSL**: Full cross-platform support with universal launcher scripts
- **PyO3 Python bindings**: Seamless integration with ML/data pipelines and Python workflows

### 6. **Built for Scale and Future-Proofing**
- **Multi-GPU**: Out-of-the-box support for advanced rigs and clusters
- **Memory optimization**: GPU RAM auto-detection, safe allocation, and fallback to hybrid CPU/GPU when needed
- **Benchmark modes**: Push your hardware to the limit with tiers from 1MB to 1TB

## ðŸŽ® **The Message for V2**

**MMH-RS V2 isn't an upgradeâ€”it's a paradigm shift.**
- What used to take hours, now takes minutes
- Fold and unfold models, directories, and datasets with the power of your GPUâ€”no hacks, no loss, no BS
- Built for AI, tested on real rigs, ready for the new wave of model-driven workflows
- If your hardware can keep up, V2 will find the ceiling. If not, you'll know exactly where the bottleneck is
- **Stop compressing like it's 2010. V2 is here.**
