**Engineered by Rob + Kai (Syntari)**
*This isn’t just a file compressor. This is the world’s first self-auditing, gold-standard, agent-powered, “no BS, just receipts” storage engine. If your files are junk, it’ll say so. If your hardware’s weak, you’ll see. If you try to cheat, the logs make it public. No games. No hiding.*

## 💡 What is MMH-RS?

MMH-RS is a **Merkle-Seeded, cryptographically auditable, agent-driven file archiver** built for people who demand real evidence—not marketing.

* **No vaporware, no fine print.** Every number is public, every test reproducible, every log undeniable.
* Built for **hackers, engineers, reviewers, and anyone sick of storage lies**.

---

## 🔥 What Makes MMH-RS a Game-Changer?

* **Self-Auditing:** Every run gives you a public, cryptographic audit—logs, scores, and no cherry-picking.
* **Gold Standard Baseline:** 32GB, 83/100, on real hardware. Want to flex? Beat it and prove it.
* **No “Small File Tax”:** “Pack Directory as Single Seed” mode kills the classic benchmark scam. One directory, one seed, zero bloat.
* **Live Everything:** Real-time stats, progress bars, abort whenever. You see bottlenecks and system drag as it happens.
* **Cross-Platform, Zero Headaches:** Windows, Linux, macOS. Full feature set on all platforms.
* **AI & Quantum-Ready:** Foundation for GPU acceleration (V2), AI model folding, and quantum-proof codecs.

## 🚦 Quick Start (CLI + Menu)

**Windows**

```powershell
cargo build --release
./target/release/mmh.exe
# Or the universal menu:
mmh_universal.bat
```

**Linux/macOS**

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/mmh
# Or:
./mmh.sh
```

**Main Menu Highlights**

* **Benchmark Menu:** From 2GB “Toasty” to 1TB “RAMpocalypse.” Pick your stress test.
* **Pack Directory as Single Seed:** Destroy the “small file penalty.”
* **Agent+Human Testing:** Full audit, full debug logs, zero dark corners.
* **Advanced Ops:** Clean up, system rebuild, deep diagnostics.
* **Full CLI/Interactive:** Power tools for power users.

## 🏅 Gold Standard Baseline (2025-07-22)

| Tier           | Files | Size (GB) | System Specs                | Score  | Status  |
| -------------- | ----- | --------- | --------------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Memory Madness | 7360  | 32        | i7-13620H / 64GB / RTX 4070 | 83/100 | GOLD ⭐️ |
| Swapocalypse   | 10k+  | 64+       | \[Tested by Rob/Kai]        | \[---] | \[soon] |

**Want to beat it?** Run your own, upload the log, and compare. If you fake, the audit will call you out—instantly.
