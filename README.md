**Built and refined by Rob + Kai (aka Syntari)**  
*This is not just another file compressor. This is the world's first self-auditing, gold-standard, agent-powered, "no games, just proof" storage engine for the real world. If your files are trash, it'll let you know. If your hardware sucks, it'll find out. If you cheat, it'll catch you—publicly.*

## 💡 What is MMH-RS?

MMH-RS is a **Merkle-Seeded, agent-driven, cryptographically accountable file archiver**. It shreds the old rules for data benchmarks, exposes system bottlenecks, and sets a baseline for the next era of high-entropy compression and AI data movement.  
- **No fluff. No vaporware.** Just real numbers, provable benchmarks, and no "small file tax" games.
- Designed for **hackers, engineers, and reviewers** who want evidence, not excuses.

---

## 🔥 Why Is This Groundbreaking?

- **Real Self-Audit:** Every run produces an auditable log and score—no hidden failures, no cherry-picked numbers.
- **Gold Baseline:** 32GB, 83/100 run on real hardware. If you can beat it, prove it.
- **Tiny File Fix:** "Pack directory as single seed" eliminates the "small file tax." Real-world benchmarks, no rigging.
- **Live Stats, Abort, Meter:** You see progress, memory, and bottleneck in real time. Abort safely at any time.
- **Cross-Platform:** Windows, Linux, macOS—all work, no BS.
- **AI-Ready:** Foundation for V2/V3: GPU support, AI model folding, quantum-level codecs.

## 🚦 Quick Start (CLI + Menu)

### **Windows**
```powershell
# In project folder:
cargo build --release
./target/release/mmh.exe
# ...or run the universal menu:
mmh_universal.bat
```

### **Linux/Mac**
```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/mmh
# ...or run:
./mmh.sh
```

### **Main Menu**
- **Benchmark Menu (Tiers):** From 2GB to 1TB, pick your stress level.
- **Pack Directory as Single Seed:** Eliminate the small-file penalty.
- **Full Self-Audit:** Agent+Human test with full debug logs.
- **Advanced Features:** Cleanup, diagnostics, rebuild, export.
- **Full CLI/Interactive:** For power users and hackers.

## 🏅 Gold Standard Baseline (As of 2025-07-22)

| Tier | Files | Size (GB) | System (i7-13620H, 63GB RAM) | Score | Status |
|------|-------|-----------|------------------------------|-------|--------|
| Memory Madness | 7360 | 32 | Win11 Pro, 2025 | 83/100 | GOLD ⭐️ |
| Swapocalypse | 10k+ | 64+ | [Tested by Rob/Kai] | [---] | [soon] |

Want to run your own? Just hit "Benchmark," upload your results, and compare. If you cheat, the log will roast you.

"My files are special!": Try the "Pack Directory as Single Seed" option. You get one .seed, no overhead games.
