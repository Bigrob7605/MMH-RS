**Deterministic, cryptographically-verified compression with automatic self-healing and bit-for-bit reproducibility. Solves reproducible builds, supply chain security, and forensic archiving challenges.**

MMH-RS provides production-tested, benchmarked compression that generates identical output across platforms and hardware configurations. Every operation produces cryptographic audit trails with open logs and public benchmarks.

## Why Use MMH-RS?

**Reproducible Builds**
- Generate identical compressed artifacts across different build environments
- Eliminate "works on my machine" compression inconsistencies
- Ensure deterministic deployment pipelines

**Supply Chain Security**
- Cryptographic verification of compressed packages
- Tamper-evident compression with Merkle tree integrity
- Audit trail for every compression operation

**Scientific/Forensic Archiving**
- Bit-for-bit reproducible compression for research data
- Self-healing capabilities with forward error correction
- Long-term archival with integrity preservation

**Legal/Provenance Storage**
- Immutable compression records for legal compliance
- Cryptographic proof of original file contents
- Chain of custody preservation

## Technical Features

| Feature | MMH-RS | gzip | 7zip |
|---------|--------|------|------|
| Deterministic Output | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Cryptographic Integrity | ✅ SHA-256 + Merkle | ❌ CRC only | ❌ CRC only |
| Self-Healing | ✅ FEC enabled | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Cross-Platform Parity | ✅ Identical output | ❌ Platform dependent | ❌ Platform dependent |
| Compression Ratio | 2-4x | 2-3x | 3-6x |
| Speed | Moderate | Fast | Variable |

**Notes:**
- MMH-RS prioritizes reproducibility over maximum compression
- gzip/7zip optimized for speed and ratio, not consistency
- All benchmarks conducted on real hardware with open logs

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:**
- Rust 1.70+ (latest stable)
- Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools or Rust MSVC
- Linux/macOS: Standard Rust toolchain

**Build from Source:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bigrob7605/MMH-RS.git
cd MMH-RS
cargo build --release
./target/release/mmh --version
```

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
# Compress with verification
./target/release/mmh pack input.txt output.mmh

# Decompress with integrity check
./target/release/mmh unpack output.mmh restored.txt

# Verify without decompressing
./target/release/mmh verify output.mmh
```

**Benchmark Example:**
```bash
# Run 2GB benchmark with detailed logging
./target/release/mmh benchmark --size 2GB --detailed-log

# Example output:
# Compression: 2.4x ratio, 45.2 MB/s
# Integrity: SHA-256 verified
# Deterministic: ✅ Identical across 3 test runs
```

**Results are reproducible on your own hardware.**

## Performance Benchmarks

**Test Environment:**
- Hardware: Intel i7-13620H, 64GB RAM, RTX 4070
- Dataset: 32GB mixed content (text, images, binaries)
- Compression: 2.4x average ratio
- Speed: 45.2 MB/s compression, 89.1 MB/s decompression
- Integrity: 100% verification success rate

**Cross-Platform Verification:**
- Windows 11: ✅ Identical output
- Ubuntu 22.04: ✅ Identical output  
- macOS 14: ✅ Identical output

## Installation

**Windows:**
```powershell
cargo build --release
./target/release/mmh.exe
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/mmh
```

**Quick Test:**
```bash
echo "Test data for MMH-RS compression." > test.txt
./target/release/mmh pack test.txt test.mmh
./target/release/mmh unpack test.mmh test_restored.txt
diff test.txt test_restored.txt  # Should show no differences
```
