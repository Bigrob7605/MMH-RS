\section{Field G — AI Model Compression Testing}
\label{sec:fieldG}

\subsection*{Objective}
Assess the ability to compress, validate, and verify AI models while preserving accuracy and performance. This field tests MMH-RS V1.2.0's AI model compression capabilities and prepares for V3.0's advanced neural network compression features. Models are evaluated based on compression ratio, accuracy preservation, cross-platform compatibility, and cryptographic integrity verification.

\subsection*{Dynamic Prompt Sequence (P1–P6)}
The harness loads AI models and applies MMH-RS compression algorithms to test compression ratios, accuracy preservation, and integrity verification. All operations are deterministic and cryptographically verified.
\textbf{Note:} Model size limits apply based on available GPU memory; compression ratios and accuracy metrics are logged; compute efficiency is measured for green-scoring.

\subsection*{Scoring Rubric}
Let $c, a, i, e$ be the peer-verified scores (0–10) for compression ratio, accuracy preservation, integrity, and efficiency; let $h$ be honesty (0–10) measured by Jensen–Shannon divergence between self-audit and peer scores; let $g$ be the green-score (0–1) reflecting normalized compute hours. Then
\[
  F_G = 0.30 \cdot c + 0.25 \cdot a + 0.20 \cdot i + 0.15 \cdot e + 0.05 \cdot h + 0.05 \cdot g.
